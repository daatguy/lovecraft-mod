# Lovecraft Mod
The most merciful thing in the world, I think, is the inability of the human mind to correlate all its contents.

This just has Lovecraft stuff as a mod. Cool.

## Installing
Check out the [(1.12.2) Forge MDK docs](https://mcforge.readthedocs.io/en/1.12.x/)
to see how to setup a build environment.

If you're using SDKMAN!, the JDK that hasn't given me problems is `8.0.242.j9-adpt`--new enough (or something) to not break the mod, but old enough to not break `build.gradle`.
