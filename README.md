# Lovecraft Mod
The most merciful thing in the world, I think, is the inability of the human mind to correlate all its contents.

This just has Lovecraft stuff as a mod. Cool.

## Installing

I hereby give all legal, extralegal, paralegal, meta-legal, sharia-law, and other permission,

### POST SCRIPT

Nathaniel says I should include the GPL for legal purposes.

Fuck the law and all, but he's probably right.
